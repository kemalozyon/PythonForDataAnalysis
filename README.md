# Python for Data Analysis — Practice Notes

This repository contains my personal notes, exercises, and examples while following the book ***“Python for Data Analysis”* by Wes McKinney**.

It’s a learning journey through the foundations of data analysis and scientific computing with Python.

## 📚 Libraries Used

The main tools and libraries I’ve been using throughout this journey:

- **NumPy** – for numerical computing and handling multi-dimensional arrays.
- **pandas** – for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.
- **matplotlib** – for creating visualizations and exploring data patterns.
- **IPython and Jupyter** – for interactive coding, testing, and documentation.
- **SciPy** – for scientific and statistical computing.
- **scikit-learn** – for applying machine learning techniques on datasets.
- **statsmodels** – for statistical modeling and hypothesis testing.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to build a solid understanding of:

- Data manipulation and exploration with pandas and NumPy.
- Visualization and storytelling through data using matplotlib.
- Statistical and machine learning applications with SciPy, scikit-learn, and statsmodels.
- Writing reproducible, clean, and well-documented analysis in Jupyter Notebooks.

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter scipy scikit-learn statsmodels

```

Then, start Jupyter Notebook with:

```bash
jupyter notebook

```

## ✍️ Notes

This repository is for learning and reference purposes only.

It reflects my progress, experiments, and interpretations of the concepts covered in the book.
